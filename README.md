# LogicProX_MidiFX_Scripts
A few scripts I've created for Logic Pro X / Main Stage 3.

This script can trigger midi notes with randomization, various modalities, and other fun parameters. This version is a script for Logic Pro X / Main Stage 3 MidiFX Scripter module.

MidiRotator
A midi input processor that rotates among various programmable harmonies. Originally created for Michael Brecker using a trick on the Oberheim X-Pander. This version is a script for Logic Pro X / Main Stage 3 MidiFX Scripter module.
